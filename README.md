 This project introduces an app designed to enhance
communication and connection between nursery schools,
parents, and teachers. The app provides real-time updates and
secure messaging, allowing parents to stay informed about their
child's activities and well-being during school hours. Additionally,
it offers features such as meal tracking, incident reporting,
administrative functions, and a fun educational games section for
children to engage in friendly competition. The aim is to improve
parental involvement, streamline administrative tasks, and foster
smoother communication between parents and teachers.
