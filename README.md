 The Backend of this project https://github.com/masamasri01/mommyBridge-BE/tree/main.
 The demo of the mobile app and games on this link https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1kMut-e6HFk4yQxIxK-oz39ZNIZBXDwHE
 This project introduces an app designed to enhance
communication and connection between nursery schools,
parents, and teachers. The app provides real-time updates and
secure messaging, allowing parents to stay informed about their
child's activities and well-being during school hours. Additionally,
it offers features such as meal tracking, incident reporting,
administrative functions, and a fun educational games section for
children to engage in friendly competition. The aim is to improve
parental involvement, streamline administrative tasks, and foster
smoother communication between parents and teachers.

hobbies and preferences and allergies, to ensure that the nursery
